# Readme
This is the Git repository of my "Assembly for the SNES" 65c816 ASM tutorial, [hosted at SMW Central](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14268). I have open sourced it so that the ROM hacking community may improve upon it. 

This online, open-source version of the tutorial can be accessed here: https://ersanio.gitbook.io/assembly-for-the-snes/
